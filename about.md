I'm the enterprise architect which means I spend lots of time leading 
and mentoring teammates, fixing problems, and being the liaison between 
the OTSS nerds and the executive leadership team/school board/legislature.

I also have very important beliefs that, while not immutable, are common 
enough to be habitual. I also expect you to hold me accountable to these ideas.

My leadership & management views will help you get a sense of what it's like to 
work with me.

Technical strategy is our lifeblood. 
Learn the what & the why.
If you don't know what to talk about with me, here are some ideas.

And as much as I'd love to say all of these ideas are my own, I practice what I preach 
when I say to stand on the shoulders of giants. Thank you to [Jason Fried][fried], [Oren Ellenbogen][ellenbogen], [Gene Kim][kim] and others.-dk
