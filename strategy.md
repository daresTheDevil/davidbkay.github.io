I believe in an office that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of team members 
and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to our company. 
I also believe that digital services follow repeatable patters, and if we can identify, document, implement 
and improve shared strategies, we can be better, create better products and help our customers.

## Acquire, deploy and sustain a technology enabled workforce

We must define and identify our capabilities to forecast staffing needs and effectively plan for future hiring. We should work in a way that makes us an employer where employees WANT to work and come to us. That being said, we must streamline recruitment, hiring & on-boarding processes to make employees feel welcome. IT employees must constantly learn to continue providing first-class digital services, therefore we must allow them to train & learn to increase their own value and the value of the company.

## Structure contracts and budgets for delivery

Projects must be planned in a modular way so that, should outside contracting or services be required, requirements can be easily defined and outside proposals can be well defined and cost effective.

## Understand users' needs

IT personnel make many assumptions about the way users will interact with their products. A successful manager on a successful project will always consider how his USERS, not his employees will use the system. I love hallway tests and integrating customers' views and opinions when planning products.

## Ensure service ownership

One person should be the leader of every product. This is not to point blame, but to encourage ownership and promote pride in products, processes and team members.

## Use data for decisions

Back to the issue of assumptions...managers can often make decisions based on popularity (Gartner's magic quadrant) or gut feelings. A robust monitoring and alerting framework can help a manager discover and develop the right products and workflows to enable his teams to work at their best.

## Address the user experience

IT employees use technology everyday, and therefore we sometimes make decisions based on our perspective and assumptions. We must break out of this mold and develop with the input of end-users since their experience will ultimately decide if a project is successful. If users must be extensively trained to use a product, it's time to rethink the user interface and design to improve the user experience.

## Be modular, composable, simple & intuitive

Intuitive applications make for happy users, and happy users make successful products. Creating smaller, modular applications with well defined scopes allow us to combine application components to solve problems in new and innovative ways. If workflows and processes are well defined, modular components can be easily improved or replaced with little or no effect on the end-user. Simplicity and composability allow us to focus on workflows instead of technologies, off-loading repeatable processes to operations and allowing developers to focus on building beautiful, usable, secure and innovative applications.

## Be iterative

When technology only changed annually, it was easy to plan software projects from inception to delivery. Today, technologies planned for at the inception of a project can realistically no longer exist at the end of multi-year projects. Being iterative allows us to elicit constant feedback from employees, management and users to develop better products and improve delivery.

## Develop with flexible hosting in mind

Modern virtual and container technologies allow software to be developed in a way that ensures that infrastructure is constant from a developer's machine, through the testing process and into production. Software bugs are caught earlier in development and ultimately fixed before production. Flexible hosting development also empowers a customer to be open-minded with regards to hosting on-prem or in the cloud, and promotes disaster recovery by allowing an application to run on any available platform.

## Automate testing & deployments

Git revolutionized the way teams collaborated in software development. Automated testing and deployments have revolutionized application quality and availability. Automated testing and feedback ensures problems are caught early in the development process, and automating deployments ensures that software problems and bugs can be fixed in hours or days instead of weeks or months.

## Address security & privacy early in the development process

Most modern applications deal with sensitive information in some way...whether personal information in a student information system or financial information in the case of an online store. Modern data privacy regulations such as GDPR levy stiff fines on companies who don't successfully protect user information. Secure coding standards, static code analysis and active security and penetration testing can highlight malformed input handling, flawed business logic and authentication/authorization manipulation. This early testing can help guide security focused architecture principles and security response policies.

## Develop enterprise monitoring and support responses

This is a simple, but often overlooked, part of a successful digital services organization. We must know what our systems are doing at all times. We must set sane defaults and ensure our systems inform us when systems fall outside of our established parameters. This includes everything from network throughput to server performance to application availability. Alerts must also link to documented, practiced and tested response and disaster recovery plans that can be implemented by multiple employees in the case of primary employees not being available.

## Use the right tool for the right job

Most problems in IT service organizations stem from unhappy employees. IT workers are particular about their tools and when they're forced to use unfamiliar or inelegant tools, productivity and happiness suffers. We should be open to the use of all appropriate tools, whether open-source, commercial or developed in-house.
