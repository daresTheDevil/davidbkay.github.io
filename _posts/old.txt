I'm the enterprise architect which means I spend lots of time leading
and mentoring teammates, fixing problems, and being the liaison between 
the OTSS nerds and the executive leadership team/school board/legislature. 

I also have very important beliefs that, while not immutable, are common 
enough to be habitual. I also expect you to hold me accountable to these ideas.My leadership & management views will help you get a sense of what it's like to work with me.Our technical strategy is our lifeblood. Learn the what & the why.If you don't know what to talk about with me, here are some ideas.And as much as I'd love to say all of these ideas are my own, I practice what I preach when I say to stand on the shoulders of giants. Thank you to Jason Fried, Oren Ellenbogen, Gene Kim and others.-dk
