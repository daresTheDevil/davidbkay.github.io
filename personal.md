I've been told that I can come across as intimidating. This isn't really my intent, it's just who I am. 
If you're worried about starting a conversation, here are a few things I love that you can use to break the ice.

**I love my family.** I have a beautiful wife and two beautiful daughters. Ask me about them. Tell me about your family.

**If you race it, it's a race car.** I love all fast things...boats, planes, cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, etc. 

**I love soccer.** My Bayern Munich fan-club membership was passed to me by my grandfather. Mia-san-mia.

**I've been lucky enough to travel in my life.** I love to hear stories about your travels and give advice on where to go if you're interested.

**I don't care about celebrities.** If you want to make fun of them with me, I'll be your friend.

**I love music.** Especially Hot Water Music and Rise Against, but I listen to pretty much anything. Even country.
